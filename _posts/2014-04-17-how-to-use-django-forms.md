#django.forms is Django’s form-handling library.

While it is possible to process form submissions just using Django’s HttpRequest class, using the form library takes care of a number of common form-related tasks. Using it, you can:

Display an HTML form with automatically generated form widgets.

Redisplay a form in the case of validation errors.
Convert submitted form data to the relevant Python data types.
