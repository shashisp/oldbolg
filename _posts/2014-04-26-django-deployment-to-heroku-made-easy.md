I got bored with setting up dev-env and intalling django-toolbelt everytime i start new project,
I searched for many Heroku-Django Boilerplates and i got one, in that they were putting all static files in to AWS, U know that i hate AWS as they ask for CREDIT CARD NUMBER

So i created a simple Heroku-Django Boilerplate project named iboilerplate, right now its integrated with Django-registration, sure i will update with few more packages! :D

you can access it here! <a href="https://github.com/shashisp/iboilerplate">iBoilerPlate</a>

feel free to add features! :)
